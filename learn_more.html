                            The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency of the United States, these agencies exist outside the federal executive departments, whose purpose is to enforce the financing of electoral campaigns at the federal, state, and local levels in United States federal elections. Created in 1974 through amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act the commission describes its duties as "to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of Presidential elections."

                        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
                            The FEC was established in 1974, in an amendment of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), to enforce and regulate campaign finance law. Initially, its six members were to be appointed by both houses of Congress and the President, reflecting a strong desire for Congress to retain control. Two commissioners were to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and two by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, each upon recommendation by the respective majority and minority leaders in that chamber, and the last two appointed by the President. They were to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress, rather than only by the Senate. The appointment process was invalidated in 1976, in Buckley v.
                            Valeo, when the Supreme Court held that the commissioners of the FEC were “Officers of the United States” under the Appointments Clause and must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Congress then amended the FECA to comply with Buckley and now the six FEC commissioners are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Since 1990, the FEC has grown more polarized, with considerable deadlocks in decision-making.

                        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
                            The commission consists of six members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Each member is appointed for a six-year term, each ending on April 30, and two commissioners are appointed every two years. However, commissioners will continue to serve after their terms would expire until a replacement is confirmed but may resign at any time. By law, no more than three commissioners can be members of the same political party. The commission had less than six members for seven 7 years after the resignation of Ann Ravel in March 2017. President Donald Trump nominated James E. Trainor III (Republican) on September 14, 2017, for a term expiring April 30, 2023, to enable replacement for Lee Goodman (Republican), who resigned in February 2018, creating a second vacancy. When Matthew Petersen (Republican) resigned on August 31, 2019, the commission had only three members, and was unable to conduct most of its regulatory and decision-making functions due to lack of a quorum. Trainor was confirmed by the Senate on May 19, 2020, restoring the commission's quorum of four. One meeting was held online, due to the coronavirus pandemic, on June 18, 2020. On June 25, however, Caroline Hunter resigned, effective July 3, with the result that the commission once again lacked a quorum. On December 9, three new members were confirmed by the Senate. The chair of the commission rotates among the commissioners each year, with no member serving as chair more than once during a six-year term. However, a commissioner may serve as chair more than once if they serve beyond the six-year mark and no successor is appointed; for example, Ellen L. Weintraub was chair in 2003, 2013 and 2019. The chair of the commission in 2020 is James Trainor, who was elected on June 18, 2020, succeeding Caroline Hunter.
